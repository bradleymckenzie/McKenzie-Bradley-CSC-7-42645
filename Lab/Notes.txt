Notes: three of the most important statements
universal statement == says that a certain property is true for all elements in a set ( eg, all positive numbers are greater than zero)
conditional statement == says that if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true ( eg, if 378 is divisible by 18, then 378 is divisible by 6)
existential statements == says that there is at least one thing for which the property is true ( eg, there is a prime number that is even )



universal conditional statements
	A universal conditional statement is a statement that is both universal and conditional.
		eg, for all animals a, if a is a dog, then a is a mammal
	

universal existential statements
		is a statement that is universal because its first part says that a certain property is true for all objects of a given type, and it is existential because its second part asserts the existence of something.
		eg, every real number has an addictive inverse
	
existential universal statement 
	is a statement that is existential because its first part asserts that a certain object exists and is universal because its second part says that the object satisfies a certain property for all things of a certain kind.
	eg, there is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer
	

	
for example if a1, a2, a3.... is a sequence of real numbers saying that
	the limit of an as n approaches infinity is L
	
means that
	for all positive real numbers e, there is an integer N such that
	for all integers n, if n > N then –e < an – L < e.

another example of doing limits
an = 1 - 2^-n 

so the limit approaches 1 because 2^-n goes to 0 so 1 - 0 will equal 1



~~~ chapter 2 sets ~~~

set-roster notation == A set may be specified using the by writing all of its elements between the braces. (eg, {1,2,3,4})

axiom of extension == says that a set is completely determined by what its elements are--not the order in which they might be listed or the fact that some elements might be listed more than once.

Set symbols
R == set of all real numbers
Z == set of all integer
Q == set of all rational numbers, or quotients of integers
N == set of nonnegative integers


Venn diagram

R (            Q(               Z(            )               )            )

note the number 0 is neither negative nor positive 

subsets 
	if a and b are sets, then a is called a subset of b, written a 
	
proper subset == let A and B be sets, A is a proper subset of B if, and only if every element of A is in B  but there is at least one element of B that is not A



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the logic of compound statements

common form if p or q the r.

statement == is a sentence that is true or false but not both


~ == not
^ == and
\/ == or

p^q == the conjunction of p and q
p\/q == the disjunction of p and q

De Morgan's laws
~( h ^ s ) == ~h \/ ~s
~( h \/ s ) == ~h ^ ~s

tautology is a statement form that is always true regard less of the truth values of the individual statements substituted  for its statement variable. a statement whose form is a tautology is a tautological statement.

a contradiction is a statement form that is always false regardless of the truth values of the individual statements substituted for its statement variables. a statement whose form is a contradiction is a contradictory statement



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
conditional statements

pemdos order first to last
~, ^ \/, ->  <->


contrapositive of a conditional statement of the form "if p then q" is 
	if ~Q the ~p
symbolically
	the contraoisutuve if p -> q is ~q -> ~p
	
	
suppose the conditional statement is the form of "if p then q"

the converse "if q then p"  === q -> p
the inverse is "if ~p the ~q" === ~p -> ~q

if p and q are statements,
 p only f q means " if not q then not p" === "if p then q"
 
 iff == if and only if

how to get p xor q

p	q p xor q		
t	t	f				
t	f	t				
f	t	t				
f	f	f				

~( p ^ q ) \/ ( p ^ ~q) \/ ( ~p ^ q) \/ ~( ~p ^ ~q )  === p xor q

universal statements

predicate is a sentence that contains finite number of vaiables and becomes a statement when specific values are subisition (cont..)

the universal quantifier: upside down a

counterexample is atleast one case where is it not true for all


method of exhaustion is the technique used to show the truth of the universal statement

existential quantifier == backwards E
eg) backwards E a person p such that p is a student in math 140

modus ponens === valid
p -> q
p
therfore q

modus tollens === valid
p->q
~q
therefore ~p

inverse error === invalid
p->q
~p
therefore ~q

converse === invlaid
q -> p
q
therfore p

transivity === valid
p->q
q->r
therefore p->r

universal modus ponens

for all x, if P(x) the Q(x).
P(a) for a particular a
therefore Q(a)

P(x) = ax^n + bx^n-1 + ... + c

lim P(x)
x->inf		== inf
